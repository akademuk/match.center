                        <ul class="info-container-nav">

                                Number of sports available. The more options a bookmaker has to offer, the easier it is for a customer to pick a necessary bet. There are around 20-25 types of sport offered on average. If there are obviously less sports than the number above a betting site loses points, otherwise it gets more. Best betting sites  in the UK offer up to 40 sports to bet on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Number of markets offered for top football events. This sport is very popular in the UK, so every bookmaker accepts football bets. Companies may show their advantages via a number and a variety of markets offered for this sport.

                                Margin. This is the thing that determines a bookmaker's guaranteed income. This is some kind of a customer’s fee. Margin was assessed based on two big markets - over/under and handicaps. The companies were further divided into three categories: low margin (up to 2.99%), medium margin (up to 4.99%), and high margin. The best rating goes to the companies with a low margin.
                            </li>

                    <p style="margin:0;">The next step after the margin evaluation is to assess the UK sports betting sites based on what odds they offer.</p>

                    <p>We take margin into account when we evaluate betting odds. The margin determines a bookmaker’s fee. If the margin is low the odds are more attractive for the customers.</p>
                    <p>Every betting site has markets with low, medium, or high odds. This highly depends on the level of a tournament, the popularity of a market, and the possibility to find enough information to make the right prediction. Events with high margins are not good for customers as such a bet is risky. However, the winnings will be more, too.</p>
                    <p>You need to choose what level of risk fits you more. High odds are not always a reason to place a bet. This is why the rating doesn’t contain a separate score for this parameter.</p>

                    <p>The main criterion in this case is the number of available deposit and withdrawal methods. Good online sports betting sites in the UK have many options, so their customers could choose the one they like most.</p>
                    <p>Of course, most of the UK customers use just a couple of payment methods. However, if a bookmaker integrated many payment systems, it shows that the company cares about the clients. So, UK betting sites with a wide range of payment methods have an advantage.</p>

                    <p>For a better rating, an online bookmaker should provide apps for both Android and iOS devices. Any other software is not counted as it’s not really widespread. StatCounter reports that Android has 48.9% of the British mobile market and iOS has 50.55%. A bookmaker gets equal points for offering both apps.</p>

                    <p>Live betting is attractive because it allows you to see what exactly is happening on the pitch before betting on a team or a player. Almost each British betting site offers a live betting service today. We rate online bookmakers based on the markets variety they offer.</p>
                    <p>Streaming demands quite a large financial investment as good technological platforms, and broadcasting rights are needed. If all the features for live betting are available, that means that the UK betting site cares about customers' betting experience.</p>
                    <p>Extra points are given to the sports betting sites that offer a schedule of upcoming events, a feature of adding an event you like to a special list, and other interesting features.</p>

                <p>This is one of the oldest British bookmakers. The company was founded in 1928. The previous name of this bookmaker was Horserace Totalisator Board. UK Tote Group currently owns the brand. The name clearly tells us that this operator is focused on a tote, so it’s not a classical fixed-odds bookmaker. Only two sports are available for betting. These are football and racing.</p>

            <p class="table-info-border">
            *Our table contains not only betting sites, but also websites of companies that operate as betting exchanges. Unlike sportsbooks, which set odds themselves, exchanges only coordinate transactions between customers. Therefore the range of betting markets on such websites is usually much shorter than in bookmaker companies, and contains only the most liquid markets. Betting exchanges have no margin and they earn in another way - by charging a commission on winnings. Please note that Betfair, a betting company, is also known as an exchange throughout the world. In the table presented above we evaluate the website and mobile applications of the Betfair sportsbook.</p>
            <h2>Betting Offers and Promotions</h2>
            <p>Online sports betting sites  in the UK offer promotions and bonuses to attract new punters and increase or return the interest of already registered users. Most often UK betting sites offer free bets for a first bet or a first no-risk bet insurance (which you will get only if your bet loses) to beginners.</p>
            <p class="table-info-border">
                Such free bets and free insurances are offered only to bettors who have not previously registered with the bookmaker. You are not allowed to create a second or third account in order to get bonuses. Betting sites offer other promotions to regular active customers – these promotions are known with a common name of loyalty programs.
            </p>
            <h2>A Free Bet Awarded After Making a Deposit</h2>
            <p>A free bet token for a first bet is usually awarded when a customer places a single bet or sometimes an accumulator bet. The value of bettors 's own bet must be not less than specified in the rules, and it must be placed at min odds specified in the terms. Of course, you must register first and make a deposit to your account. Most often the outcome of a qualifying bet is not important and the user gets a free bet even in case of loss.</p>
            <p>General rules for using free bets:</p>
            <nav class="info-container-evaluate">
                <ul class="info-container-nav">
                    <li>A free bet is valid for a limited time. If you do not use the bonus in time, it will expire.
                    </li>
                    <li>A free bet cannot be immediately withdrawn or converted into money. It should be used only for betting.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the customer's bet wins, his winnings will go to the main balance and he will be able to withdraw this money. The free bet amount is not included in the winnings.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <p>Some promotions require a promo code. Besides, rules may include additional conditions for wagering.</p>

            <h2>Other Bonuses for New and Regular Bettors</h2>
            <p>The most interesting offer for beginners is a no deposit bonus. It gives an opportunity to get free bets to your bonus account immediately after registration without making a deposit.</p>
            <p>The reward is given for registration and verification, sometimes in a mobile application. Like other free bets, these betting offers can be used to make real bets and try to win without the risk of losing your own cash. It's worth noting that even best betting sites in the UK do not appreciate any deposit bonuses. This is probably due to the cost of user acquisition: in the British competitive market it is high, and the bookmaker wants to receive a deposit and a bet from a beginner, and not just his registration.</p>
            <p>The experts of Match.Center have searched  throughout Great Britain and managed to find only one no deposit bonus. It is provided by SkyBet. After registering on a special promotion page beginners receive a £10 free bet from the bookmaker. It is awarded without requirements to make a deposit, but in order to receive it you still need to link a bank card to your account on the bookmaker's website.</p>
            <p>It is interesting that British online sports betting sites ignore another widespread bonus option almost completely: a proportional bonus for a deposit. This bonus is provided for making a deposit of a certain amount. Online bookmakers usually add 100% to the deposit  for beginners, and for those who already have an account they add 10-50%. The reward for making a deposit comes as money to a bonus account or as a free bet. You can spend it on bets of a certain type at odds specified in the rules. Before the withdrawal of bonus funds  they must be wagered in accordance with the terms of the promotion.</p>
            <p>The experts of Match.Center found the only bookmaker offering  a proportional deposit bonus - it is Betway. You can receive a welcome bonus of 100% of the first deposit, but not more than £10. Yes, you got it right: not 100, not 1000 pounds, but only 10. It may look like a mockery of the idea since many other British online betting sites offer three times as much for a first deposit of £10.</p>
            <h2>Best New Betting Sites</h2>
            <p>Match.Center has compiled a list of bonuses from companies that have recently entered the UK market. All new betting sites included are licenced. It is often new betting sites that offer the most attractive promotions as well as advanced technology solutions since they aim to make themselves known in the UK where competition is stronger than in any other market in the world.</p>
            <p class="info-color">
                If you want to qualify for a bonus, please note that almost all companies have restrictions on deposit methods. Check the information at the customer support service or in the promo description before making a deposit .

            <p>In-Play betting gives bettors the widest possible range of options to choose from, as well as more excitement and, as many believe, chances to beat the bookmaker. Of special interest are, for example, quick bets on what happens in the next 5 minutes: a free kick is given, a goal kick, a goal scored or no goal will be scored in the game, a booking. This format is accompanied by streaming right on the bookmaker's website.</p>
            <p>The leaders in the field of in-play betting have not only a wide selection of events, but also provide a quick change of odds without freezing, as well as numerous live streams for registered users. A good selection of markets in the Live mode is presented both by experienced and long-established companies like Paddy Power and Bet365 and young companies like Quinnbet.</p>

                <h2>Top Betting Sites with Cash Out</h2>
                <p>Cash out is an opportunity to cash out your bet before the end of the event. Thus, the bettor can insure himself if he changed his mind and no longer believes in the victory of the team, or if he is in a hurry to get at least some winnings. It is important to remember that the bookmaker significantly reduces the settlement odds for a Cash out option. For example, if you bet £10 at odds of 1/1 and request cashout, you will receive £6-7 in winnings. And if your team gets through to the end, you will receive £10.</p>
                <p>The bet settlement with cash out requested is tied to in-play bets: in fact, it is based on the current odds with a certain penalty. As a rule, if a bookmaker has a good Live service, cashout opportunities are wider. It is not surprising only old betting sites are among our top 5 betting companies:</p>

                        Please note: it is illegal to make deposits to a betting account using credit cards. You can only pay with debit cards, with your personal funds.
                    </p>
                    <p>All online bookmakers accept card deposits. The only difference is the minimum deposit amount. At Bet365, William Hill, Unibet and most others, the minimum deposit amount is £5, but 32red, Copybet and some other online bookies allow you to deposit at least $10 by card.</p>

                       Please note: at some companies, users who make deposits via Skrill are not allowed to participate in promotions. Be sure to clarify this point if you intend to use a bonus.

                    <p>Deposits via Skrill are accepted by Betfred, 32red, Boylesports, Leovegas and other betting sites. The minimum deposit amount is usually £5, but at 32red and a few other firms it's higher from £10.</p>

In fact, the user does double work: first he deposits the Neteller and then the bookmaker's account. But it can be used if, for some reason, there is no desire to make the card details public or there is already money in the Neteller wallet.</p>
                    <p>You can deposit via Neteller at William Hill (from £10), Paddy Power (from £5), 32red (from £10) and many other best betting sites.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Usually, you can make a deposit of at least £5 through Paysafecard. Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and most other popular betting sites have such terms and conditions. But 32red and some other companies have a slightly higher minimum deposit through Paysafecard, starting at £10.</p>

It was established in 2008 and now provides services to TransferWise, PayPal and other companies. In order to make a deposit through Trustly, the system needs to be supported by both the betting site and the customer's online bank.

                    <p>The only known company to offer deposits via Trustly is betting exchange Smarkets. The minimum deposit amount to be deposited using this payment instrument there is £40. Other companies have never offered Trustly to UK residents or have removed the facility due to low popularity. LeoVagas, William Hill and some other companies have the logo on their sites, but only people from certain countries are allowed to deposit via Trustly. The UK is not one of them.</p>

                    <p>Payments in Bitcoin are accepted by online shops and other venues. But legal betting shops in the UK are conservative and do not yet accept deposits in cryptocurrencies. Usually this deposit method is only available at offshore or illegal companies.</p>

                    <p>A bank transfer is the classic method of payment. The money is transferred between the player's and the bookmaker's accounts via online banking or a branch of a financial institution. The money is credited within 3-5 days.
                    </p>
                    <p>With William Hill, a bank transfer can be made from £25 and with Paddy Power from £5.</p>
                    <p>It is important to highlight two points. Firstly, not all betting sites support this method. For example, PokerStars Sports pays winnings by bank transfer, but does not offer to make deposits by bank transfer.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, Bank Transfer is used to withdraw your winnings when you have deposited your winnings in a way that is not suitable for withdrawals in principle. For example, Apple Pay or paysafecard.</p>

            <p>To get registered on a bookmaker’s website or in the app, choose the “sign up” or “play now” button.</p>
            <p>A screen will appear on which you must enter the first row of data. Usually this is an email and password and a promo code if a promotion is running at the time.</p>
            <p>On the following screens, the player must enter personal details: name, address, date of birth, telephone number, postal address.
                When all the data fields have been filled in, the button to complete the registration should be pressed. Before doing so, the player can read the agreement on the rules of the office, which he signs at the time of registration, and the privacy rules.</p>
            <p>When the registration is completed, the player is asked to make a deposit. This is not compulsory, just something the betting site really wants. You can actually make a deposit later, for example the next time you log in to the site. <b>You will not lose your entitlement to the new customer bonus if you do so.</b></p>

            <h2>Getting The Most Out of Sports Betting</h2>
            <p>Sports betting is a gambling hobby, but as with other intellectual activities, it is much more enjoyable to bet knowing that you know the subject and are doing everything (or almost everything) right. Let's dispel the most popular myths among beginners: how to choose a bookmaker, whether to pay attention to bonuses and what really matters, whether to get carried away with express bets and how to control your bankroll.</p>
            <h5>Choosing a bookmaker</h5>
            <p>The Telegraph's list of the top 5 most popular UK betting sites among users in 2022 includes:</p>
            <nav class="info-container-evaluate">
                <ul class="info-container-nav">
                    <li>Bet365;
                    </li>
                    <li>William Hill;
                    </li>
                    <li>Betway;
                    </li>
                    <li>Betfair;
                    </li>
                    <li>Paddy Power;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <p>These are all giant companies, pillars of the British sports betting market. And from this list you can see that most people choose a betting site based on brand strength and popularity.</p>
            <p>But there are a number of other criteria that are good to consider:</p>
            <nav class="info-container-evaluate" style="margin-bottom:40px;">
                <ul class="info-container-nav">
                    <li>Positive user reviews. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Variety of promotions and bonuses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Availability of apps.
                    </li>
                    <li>Plenty of available deposit and withdrawal methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>Quick support service.
                    </li>
                    <li>High odds on sports events.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <b class="table-info-border">We will elaborate on some points, because often it is not what the betting site wants to show on the advertising banners.</b>
            <h5 style="margin-top:40px;">Bookmaker’s promotions</h5>
            <p>For many people, the key factor in choosing a betting site is the availability of a good welcome bonus for new players. For example, a free bet for the first real money bet.</p>
            <p>And yes, bonuses are nice. It's nice to bet with the bookmaker's money, and win, too.</p>
            <p>But be careful: it's always important to understand what's "under the bonnet" of the promotion before you sign up. To give you an example, here are two exactly the same promotions, at first glance. In fact, they are very, very different.</p>
            <div class="background-table">
                <p>Example. Two leading UK betting sites Bet365 and Betway offer new customers the same free bet offer: "Welcome bonus up to £50 for the first bet". However, the terms of the promotion are different for each company.</p>

            <h5 style="margin-top:20px;">Does everybody like accumulator bets? No</h5>
            <p>At first glance, a Parlay seems to be a good deal for the player. You can put a number of events together in one bet and increase your bankroll by several times. However, at a distance, express bets are more profitable for the betting site than for the player. The main reason for this is the bookmaker's margin.</p>
            <p>Margin is the commission that is incurred in each betting market. The betting site takes this 2-10% from every bet won, at a distance of 90-98% instead of 100% of the fees collected.</p>
            <p>It doesn't matter to the company whether the client wins or loses now. Every odds already has a profit in it. And if you bet a parlay, you pay that margin multiple times - from every bet you include in the accumulator.</p>
            <h5>How to manage the bankroll</h5>
            <p>On every betting website you will read about how important it is to manage your budget properly. But what does it mean?</p>
            <p>We'll dispense with nerdy terms like "Kelly Criterion" or "Martingale System", especially as these approaches don't work for most people.</p>
            <p>Our approach works. The rule is very simple: allocate a specific amount of money within your entertainment budget for sports betting. If you win, great. But if you lose everything you've allocated, that's the end of the story. Wait for next week or month - depending on what period you're planning for.</p>
            <p>Betting is an intellectual hobby, but still it is a gambling hobby. And in order to control your bankroll, it is important to know how to:</p>

                    <li>Manage your emotions;
                    </li>
                    <li>Choose best betting sites;

                </ul>
            </nav>
            <h5>Odds and markets comparison</h5>
            <p>A good way to find favourable odds is to register on several online betting websites. Very often there are situations where betting sites estimate the probability of the outcome of the same event differently. This means that someone may have higher odds on the same betting markets.</p>
            <div class="background-table">
                <p>For example, William Hill and Betway put different odds on a draw in an English Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Leeds United.</p>
                <p>On the one hand, the difference in odds is only 1/10. However, at the distance, this painstaking approach to selecting a betting site will pay off handsomely. And not just because the payouts will be bigger. But also because a methodical comparison is a great way to resist impulse betting.</p>

                    It depends on what a bettor prefers. There’s no betting site that is perfect in every detail. Some have higher odds, the others provide better promotions or many markets for a sport you like. You need to pay attention to the details that affect your style of betting. There are common indicators of a good company, namely fast and competent customer support, apps, and a user-friendly website. We take all these factors into consideration when we rate online bookmakers.

                    You need to avoid the companies that don’t have the official UK Gambling Commission license. They work illegally and don’t obey the local law. You risk your money by using their services. In case of some problems you can barely hope for legal help. We doubt you’ll go to Curaçao to deal with the problem.

                    The largest betting sites provide almost every payment method available in the country for deposits and withdrawals. You can always use the bank card. Many betting sites accept e-payments via Skrill or ApplePay (however, you can’t withdraw the winnings, you’ll need to choose another method). Some betting sites like Paddy Power and Coral accept cash in an outlet. 888Sport accept bitcoins.
