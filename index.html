                        <h4>Variety of Sports, Markets & Bets</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Btting sites also get a rate for the markets they offer. There are 3 criteria that helps evaluate this:</p>
                    <nav class="info-container-evaluate">
                        <ul class="info-container-nav">
                            <li>
                                Number of sports available. The more options a bookmaker has to offer, the easier it is for a customer to pick a necessary bet. There are around 20-25 types of sport offered on average. If there are obviously less sports than the number above a betting site loses points, otherwise it gets more. Best betting sites  in the UK offer up to 40 sports to bet on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Number of markets offered for top football events. This sport is very popular in the UK, so every bookmaker accepts football bets. Companies may show their advantages via a number and a variety of markets offered for this sport.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Margin. This is the thing that determines a bookmaker's guaranteed income. This is some kind of a customer’s fee. Margin was assessed based on two big markets - over/under and handicaps. The companies were further divided into three categories: low margin (up to 2.99%), medium margin (up to 4.99%), and high margin. The best rating goes to the companies with a low margin.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </nav>
                    <p style="margin:0;">The next step after the margin evaluation is to assess the UK sports betting sites based on what odds they offer.</p>

                    <p>We take margin into account when we evaluate betting odds. The margin determines a bookmaker’s fee. If the margin is low the odds are more attractive for the customers.</p>
                    <p>Every betting site has markets with low, medium, or high odds. This highly depends on the level of a tournament, the popularity of a market, and the possibility to find enough information to make the right prediction. Events with high margins are not good for customers as such a bet is risky. However, the winnings will be more, too.</p>
                    <p>You need to choose what level of risk fits you more. High odds are not always a reason to place a bet. This is why the rating doesn’t contain a separate score for this parameter.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The main criterion in this case is the number of available deposit and withdrawal methods. Good online sports betting sites in the UK have many options, so their customers could choose the one they like most.</p>
                    <p>Of course, most of the UK customers use just a couple of payment methods. However, if a bookmaker integrated many payment systems, it shows that the company cares about the clients. So, UK betting sites with a wide range of payment methods have an advantage.</p>

                    <p>Every client may face issues with a bookmaker some day. In this case the way the customer support service works is very important.</p>
                    <p>Our experts have checked how this service works in every company listed in our rating. They asked a few questions and rated the online betting sites based on how fast and qualified the managers responded.</p>
                    <p>Extra points were granted to the betting sites in the UK that provide many methods of contacting the customer support service. E-mail, phone number, and a live chat are available on the website and in the app.</p>

                    <p>For a better rating, an online bookmaker should provide apps for both Android and iOS devices. Any other software is not counted as it’s not really widespread. StatCounter reports that Android has 48.9% of the British mobile market and iOS has 50.55%. A bookmaker gets equal points for offering both apps.</p>

                    <p>Live betting is attractive because it allows you to see what exactly is happening on the pitch before betting on a team or a player. Almost each British betting site offers a live betting service today. We rate online bookmakers based on the markets variety they offer.</p>
                    <p>Streaming demands quite a large financial investment as good technological platforms, and broadcasting rights are needed. If all the features for live betting are available, that means that the UK betting site cares about customers' betting experience.</p>
                    <p>Extra points are given to the sports betting sites that offer a schedule of upcoming events, a feature of adding an event you like to a special list, and other interesting features.</p>

The bookmaker covers just a few tournaments. However, horse and greyhound racing is covered quite well, including streaming on the website and in the apps. There are classical and updated designs of the website.</p>

            *Our table contains not only betting sites, but also websites of companies that operate as betting exchanges. Unlike sportsbooks, which set odds themselves, exchanges only coordinate transactions between customers. Therefore the range of betting markets on such websites is usually much shorter than in bookmaker companies, and contains only the most liquid markets. Betting exchanges have no margin and they earn in another way - by charging a commission on winnings. Please note that Betfair, a betting company, is also known as an exchange throughout the world. In the table presented above we evaluate the website and mobile applications of the Betfair sportsbook.</p>
